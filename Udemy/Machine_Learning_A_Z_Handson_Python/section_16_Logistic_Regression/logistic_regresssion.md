##### Entropy

It is the randomness in the information provided to process. Maximum the entropy, harder to get a conclusion. Ex - flip coin is the most random, because there is no realtion between tossing and getting result, hence can't be surely determined whether it be head or tails.

Logistic Regression is also called as MaxEnt Classifier
