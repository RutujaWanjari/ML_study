### Regression

A supervised learning algorithm used to predict continous values based on one or multiple predictors(features).

##### Regression Types

1. Simple Linear - Examines relationship between 2 variables only (example - X and Y, where X is an independent variable whereas Y is a dependent (on X) variable). When X increase/decrease, Y increase/decrease, hence caleed linear. Real life ex - salary structure of a company. Formula -> Y = mX + b -> Salary of an employee = slope of the line * yrs of exp + intercept. m and b are random coefficients(constants). Objective is to obtain values of m and b
2. Multiple - Y is calculated for multiple independent variables. Formula -> Y = b + m1X1 + m2X2 + .... + mnXn. Real life ex - salary structure based on 2 independent vars. Salary of an employee = intercept + slope of the line * yrs of exp +.slope of the line * yrs of education
3. Polynomial -
